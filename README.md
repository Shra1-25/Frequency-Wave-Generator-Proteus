# Frequency-Wave-Generator-Proteus
This is a Proteus simulation of Frequency Wave Generator using Microprocessor 8086.  
Open Proteus Simulation and open design_final.DSN file. Load design.bin file in the 8086 processor in the design file. Run the simulation and refer to the 'design report.pdf' for further details.
## Improvisation:
You can improvise the code and design files by including interrupts to display accurate waves for higher frequencies (>5k Hz). This can reduce the time for which Micro Processor is idle and thereby cause less delays.
